It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even

``` Markdown
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One 
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash 
or star:
  - Like this 
  - And this
```

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead. 

    def foo()
        if not bar:
            return True
            
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del>, ***tags*** 
supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of heading to structure your documents. 
Start lines with a `#` to create headings. multiple `##` in a row denote smaller 
heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before
the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised ... I beat the Borg `What is Borg? ` with it
> - Captain Janeway

## Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens
 (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe:`-` `|`
 
 First Header | Second Header
 ------------ | -------------
 Content from cell 1 | Content from all 2
 Content in the first column | Content in the second column
